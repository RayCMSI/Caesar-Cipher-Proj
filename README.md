# Caesar-Cipher-Proj

This Project is a simple accurate replication of the encoding and decoding process of a Caesar Cipher, also known as a Shift Cipher that is meant to change the characters of a message. The change of the characters is completely dependent on the number of shifts that are applied to the message.

For example if our message is simply the letter 'A' then shifting it twice will give us 'C'. 

- The first module *Caesar_Cipher* is the Caesar Cipher it's self that serve as the main basis for the over all project

- The second module *Caesar_Guesser* is a simple game that puts the cipher and the player to the test. You are given three guesses to guess what the cipher says. There are over 100 different phrases to choose from. These are all common phrases that are in the english language.

- The third module *Phrases* handles all of the different phrases nothing more.
